* Test Dependency Management
** Problem
The test runner was using manually vendored paths for dependencies (=dash=, =s=), which is not scalable or standard. We wanted to switch to =package.el= for managing development dependencies.

** Solution
- Updated =test/run-tests.el= to:
  - Initialize =package.el= with a local =.elpa/= directory.
  - Configure MELPA and GNU ELPA archives.
  - Install =ert-async=, =dash=, and =s= automatically.
  - Keep =propcheck= as a vendored dependency since it's not available on MELPA.
- Created =.gitignore= to exclude =.elpa/= and build artifacts.

** Verification
- Ran =emacs -Q --batch -l test/run-tests.el=
- Dependencies were installed to =.elpa/=.
- All 19 tests passed.

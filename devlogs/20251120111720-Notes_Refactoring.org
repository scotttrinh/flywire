* Test Dependency Management (Nix Refactoring)
** Problem
The initial Nix setup used an overlay to add =propcheck= to =emacsPackages=. This added complexity.

** Solution
- Refactored =flake.nix= to define =propcheck= as a standalone derivation using =runCommand=.
- Passed this derivation directly to =emacsWithPackages=, removing the need for an overlay.
- This simplifies the configuration while keeping the same behavior.

** Verification
- Ran =nix run .#test= and verified that tests still pass.
- Confirmed that =propcheck= is correctly included in the load path.

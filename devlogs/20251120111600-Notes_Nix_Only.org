* Test Dependency Management (Nix-only)
** Problem
We decided to fully adopt Nix for the development environment and testing, replacing the hybrid =package.el= bootstrapping approach. The =package.el= approach was flaky and required manual network access during test runs, whereas Nix provides a reproducible, offline-capable environment.

** Solution
- Updated =test/run-tests.el= to simply =require= the dependencies (=ert-async=, =dash=, =s=, =propcheck=), assuming they are provided by the environment.
- Updated =flake.nix= to:
  - Define a derivation for =propcheck= (fetching from GitHub) using =runCommand= to create a proper ELPA-style directory structure with a generated =propcheck-pkg.el=.
  - Add =propcheck= to the =emacsWithPackages= environment explicitly via =pkgs.emacsPackages.propcheck=.
- Updated =AGENT.md= to document `nix run .#test` as the standard way to run tests.

** Verification
- Ran =nix run .#test= and verified all 19 tests passed.
- Confirmed =propcheck= is correctly loaded from the Nix store.

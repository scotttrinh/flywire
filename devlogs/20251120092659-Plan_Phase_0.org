* Phase 0 Plan
** Objective
- Sketch the emacs-driver package skeleton so we can start wiring the snapshot/action/test components described in ROADMAP.org.
** Tasks
1. Outline the module structure: core entry point, snapshot helper, action executor, and supporting utilities.
2. Prepare the initial test harness (test/run-tests.el) that loads the package and runs a simple ERT case to verify we can load the driver.
3. Add a small ERT test that exercises the snapshot retrieval or a stubbed action to prove the harness works.
** Acceptance criteria
- Repository contains clearly named Elisp modules ready for Phase 1/2 work.
- Tests directory can be invoked via the documented runner and includes at least one passing case.
- Devlog documents the plan so we have traceability before coding starts.

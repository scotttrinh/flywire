* Notes: Project Rename to Flywire

** Context
We decided to move away from the utilitarian name ~emacs-driver~ to something more distinct that fits alongside "Playwright" and "Puppeteer" but captures the essence of an agent operating the editor "by instrument."

** The Winner: Flywire (~flywire.el~)
- *Metaphor*: "Fly-by-wire."
- *Why*: perfectly describes the mechanism. The agent doesn't physically touch the keyboard; it sends electronic signals (JSON) which the system interprets to move the control surfaces (buffers/windows).
- *Vibe*: Mechanical, precise, avionics.

** Other Contenders
We brainstormed several categories before landing on Avionics.

*** 1. Theatrical (The "Playwright" Siblings)
- ~stagehand.el~: The invisible force moving props behind the scenes. (Strong contender).
- ~prompter.el~: Feeds lines to the actors.
- ~maestro.el~: Conducts the orchestra.

*** 2. Puppetry (The "Puppeteer" Analogs)
- ~marionette.el~: A puppet controlled from above.
- ~ventriloquist.el~: Throwing voice/action into the editor.

*** 3. "Arms and Eyes" (The Homunculus)
- ~homunculus.el~: The "little man" inside the brain with huge hands and eyes. (Scientifically accurate but maybe too academic).
- ~waldo.el~: Sci-fi term for remote manipulators.
- ~talos.el~: The mythical bronze automaton.
- ~exo.el~: Exoskeleton.

*** 4. Avionics (The Final Choice)
- ~ifr.el~: "Instrument Flight Rules." Flying with zero visibility, relying only on telemetry.
- ~yoke.el~: The steering column.
- ~tacan.el~: Tactical Air Navigation.

** Action Taken
- Renamed all source files (`emacs-driver-*.el` -> `flywire-*.el`).
- Refactored all symbol prefixes (`emacs-driver-` -> `flywire-`).
- Updated Nix flakes and test runners.

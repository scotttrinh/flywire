* Phase 4 Plan: Property-Based Testing
** Objective
- Increase test confidence by adding property-based tests using `propcheck`.
- Verify that input simulation and action queuing work correctly for a wide range of inputs, not just hardcoded strings.

** Tasks
1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Create `test/vendor/`.
   - Clone `dash.el`, `s.el`, and `propcheck` into `test/vendor/` (manual vendoring since we aren't using Cask/Eldev yet).
   - Update `test/run-tests.el` to add these paths to `load-path`.
2. **Property Tests**:
   - Create `test/emacs-driver-property-test.el`.
   - **Test 1**: `emacs-driver-push-input`.
     - Property: For any string `S`, `unread-command-events` should contain the character list of `S`.
   - **Test 2**: `emacs-driver-simulate-keys` (Partial).
     - Property: For simple alphanumeric strings, `simulate-keys` behaves like `push-input`.
     - *Note*: We might skip complex chords for now as generating valid `kbd` strings randomly is non-trivial without a complex generator.
   - **Test 3**: `emacs-driver--windowed-content`.
     - Property: For any buffer content and any cursor position, the returned windowed content should be a substring of the buffer.

** Acceptance Criteria
- `test/run-tests.el` successfully loads `propcheck`.
- New property tests pass.
- Existing tests still pass.

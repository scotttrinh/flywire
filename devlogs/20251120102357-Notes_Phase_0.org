* Phase 0 Notes
** What Happened
- Logged the Phase 0 plan to capture objectives for structuring core files and tests.
- Added `emacs-driver.el`, `-snapshot`, and `-action` modules wired to parse JSON instructions, collect safe snapshots, and queue inputs/commands so the driver can begin supporting Phase 1/2 requirements.
- Created the test harness (`test/run-tests.el`) plus a basic ERT suite that verifies `emacs-driver-get-snapshot` returns a plist, and validated it with the documented runner.
** Verification
- `emacs -Q --batch -l test/run-tests.el`
** Next Steps
- Deepen the snapshot logic per the roadmap (window list metadata, minibuffer context, smaller text windows).
- Expand command/action helpers (more tools, atomic action sequencing) toward the Atomic Executor phase.
- Continue documenting each phase by saving future Plan/Notes entries as progress unfolds.

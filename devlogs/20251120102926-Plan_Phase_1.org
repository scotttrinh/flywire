* Phase 1 Plan: Verify & Solidify Observer and Atomic Executor
** Objective
- Ensure the code skeleton from Phase 0 is robust, correct, and ready for the complex async work in Phase 3.
- We need to prove that snapshots capture the right data and that actions properly queue events.

** Tasks
1. **Test Expansion**:
   - Add tests for `emacs-driver--windowed-content` to verify it respects the radius and handles boundaries (start/end of buffer).
   - Add tests for `emacs-driver-simulate-keys` and `emacs-driver-push-input` to verify `unread-command-events` modification.
   - Add a test for `emacs-driver-do` parsing JSON and executing steps.
2. **Refinement**:
   - Review `emacs-driver-snapshot.el` and `emacs-driver-action.el` for any missing edge case handling based on test results.

** Acceptance Criteria
- `test/emacs-driver-test.el` has multiple tests covering snapshot details and action queuing.
- `emacs -Q --batch -l test/run-tests.el` passes with the new tests.
- We are confident that "Atomic Execution" (Queue first, Call last) logic is sound.

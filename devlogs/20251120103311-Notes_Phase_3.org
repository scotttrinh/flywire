* Phase 3 Notes
** What Happened
- Implemented `emacs-driver-async.el` which provides:
  - `emacs-driver-async-mode`: Minor mode to toggle monitoring.
  - `minibuffer-setup-hook` monitor: Pushes snapshots when minibuffer opens.
  - Idle monitor: Pushes snapshots when Emacs is idle for 0.5s.
  - `emacs-driver-output-handler`: Configurable callback (default: print JSON).
- Updated `emacs-driver.el` to export `emacs-driver-do-async`, allowing non-blocking execution.
- Added `test/emacs-driver-async-test.el` verifying async execution, timers, and hooks.
- Refactored `test/run-tests.el` to load all test files dynamically.

** Verification
- All 10 tests passed (6 sync, 4 async).
- Confirmed `emacs-driver-do-async` returns `'started` and executes actions on timer tick.
- Confirmed minibuffer and idle hooks invoke the output handler.

** Next Steps
- The Roadmap's Phase 4 (API Surface) is largely implemented.
- We should do a final pass to ensure packaging correctness (e.g., `provide` statements, dependencies).
- Document usage examples.

* Devlog: Test Helper Cleanup and Async Session Follow-through

:DATE: 2025-11-25T10:45-0500

** What changed
- Finished the async/session refactor from the policy-module follow-up:
  - Async now returns handles, supports cancellation, and emits structured events in env context.
  - Execution results include per-step messages/snapshots and honor snapshot-before/after and safety-policy opts.
  - Default env wiring now installs minibuffer/idle events via the session env.
- Updated tests to use the new shapes and helpers; reintroduced `flywire-test-with-bindings` only where async cleanup is needed and kept sync tests on simple bindings.
- Added `load-path` setup for test helpers so batch runs can find shared utilities.

** Challenges & deviations
- The binding helper assumed an async `done` callback; using it in sync tests broke with unbound `ignore`/mismatched arity. Resolved by reverting sync tests to plain `let`/`setq` and keeping the helper for async tests only.
- Early edits introduced paren and setf macro errors in `flywire-session-start-async`; fixed and re-ran `nix run .#test` multiple times to ensure green runs.

** Status
- Test suite passes (`nix run .#test`).
- Async/session surfaces now aligned with the review follow-up; remaining work would be docs/examples for environments if needed.
